# Svelte + Threlte + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Threlte in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Learn

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)

[Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/getting-started#installation)

## Get started

- Download the project 
- Open the terminal, then run `npm run install`

## Run locally

- Check if the project works by running `npm run dev`

## Using in projects

- Compile into a js file by running `npm run build`. This js file can be hosted and used anywhere now
- Push it to Github, deploy on Vercel (or wherever you prefer)
- When it's deployed, copy the URL and add `/assets/index.js` to get the js file. For example, mine is `https://vite-threlte.vercel.app/assets/index.js`
- In your project, create a div with an ID of `app` (if you modified it in `main.ts` and `index.html`, obviously use that)
- Add the script to the end of your body tag `<script src="https://vite-threlte.vercel.app/assets/index.js"></script>`
- Done!
